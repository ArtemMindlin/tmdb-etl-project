The newly independent nation faced its first coup d'état, orchestrated by Western forces and Belgium, which were reluctant to relinquish control over their resource-rich former colony. The US tried to divert attention by sending jazz ambassador Louis Armstrong to the African continent.  In 1961, Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba was brutally assassinated, silencing a key voice in the fight against colonialism; his death was facilitated by Belgian and CIA operatives. Musicians Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach took action, denouncing imperialism and structural racism. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev intensified his criticism of the US, highlighting the racial barriers that characterized American society.",

The offer is refused, but Choi later becomes Dr. Man’s involuntary patient after a particularly egregious night of driving. Dr. Man has his own personal issues: his motto is “I think a doctor should do more than prescribe meds,” which means a doctor should also investigate his patients secretly in defiance of common sense and hospital protocol. In a parallel to Choi San-keung, Dr. Man also has sleeping issues. He suffers from disturbing dreams of his deceased mother, which hints at a secret involving his father (Ben Yuen), and perhaps some repressed memories. Both Dr. Man and Choi San-keung are characters tortured by dark pasts, and acknowledging these memories is key to solving their problems in the present.",

But, to begin with, they were scorned, penniless outsiders. 1874 was the year that changed everything; the first Impressionists, “hungry for independence”, broke the mould by holding their own exhibition outside official channels. Impressionism was born and the art world was changed forever.  What led to that first groundbreaking show 150 years ago? Who were the maverick personalities that wielded their brushes in such a radical and provocative way? The spectacular Musée d’Orsay exhibition brings fresh eyes to this extraordinary tale of passion and rebellion. The story is told not by historians and curators but in the words of those who witnessed the dawn of Impressionism: the artists, press and people of Paris, 1874.",

As Luca’s camera captures the intricate details of Xuan's hands at work, he awakens in Xuan a passion for life long thought lost, prompting the older man to reflect on cherished memories and connections.\r Gradually, Luca uncovers a universe distinct from his own, as he confronts the complexities of identity and heritage.\r Through shared gazes and unspoken histories, they find unexpected connections in lives that initially seemed worlds apart. As their bond deepens, they encounter the delicate interplay of life and death, illuminating the invisible threads that unite us all.",

Each time we meet a new person, we define ourselves in contrast to the other. We do not look at what connects us, but what separates us. It seems like something that is pervasive - not just for Denmark, Europe and the US, but in every possible society and culture in the world at all times. It is a common human condition that we have endless difficulty in dealing with the stranger. With this movie, I want to ask a single question that sets the world on fire. It is an exploration of my own wonder why the encounter with the stranger is so explosive and can make seemingly sensible people like myself and others mad.",

The film contemplates perception, clairvoyance, and whether the present can be seen through the lens of memory, blurring the lines between past, present, and future. As the voice moves through decaying structures, it reflects on human impermanence and defiance of time. Vignettes of past lives illustrate universal human experiences. The film concludes by pondering existence, consciousness, and humanity’s drive to create meaning amidst an indifferent universe, challenging viewers to reflect on their own place in time and memory.",

Our film seeks to explore the dimension of evil that resides within our minds and how it reflects onto the perceptions of the Hijra community. For us, this film is very special, as it is a product of our personal experiences and the desire to showcase the struggle and bliss of the third gender. We aim to tell a story that is engaging, sensitive, and respectful. Our team is excited to bring this project to life, and we hope that it will contribute to a greater understanding and appreciation of the Hijra community.",

In a raw, almost intimate form, the film interweaves the narratives of people from different backgrounds – a transgender man, a victim of sexual violence, an activist convicted of helping someone have an abortion – to create a brutally real picture of a reality in which decisions about one’s own body are a luxury available to few. There are no aesthetic filters or glamorous shots here – instead, there are emotions so thick you could cut them with a knife. Silence is no longer an option. This is a film that shocks, teases, opens your eyes, and doesn’t let you forget.",

The piece explores what remains of a poem when its language is removed, and how images might interact with each other in similar or different ways to words. It asks whether rhyme, rhythm, sibilance, or dissonance, might be effectively created by juxtaposing images. It also asks whether arranging images might create a sense of authorship, intentionality, or a tone of voice, in the way that arranging words might. Finally, Four Poems invites the viewer to consider how they might ‘read’ a poem – does a reading have to occur from top-to-bottom, or might new interpretations be possible when the moving parts of the poem can all be seen at once?",

Upon his return, with the violence still latent, Andrés delves into the deepest landscapes of his territory and the most painful memories that the war left behind, composing in memory of those who no longer walk with him; music saved him and that is why he decided that 'it is better to sing than to point out'.",

Alongside her, the charismatic Ramon Silverio transforms his cultural haven El  Mejunje into ground zero for change, taking his rainbow-colored caravan of artists  and performers deep into the countryside to challenge prejudice through the universal language of art. As archival footage reveals how machismo and religious  bigotry cast a long shadow over the queer community but then a new generation of firebrands - Las Isabellas and Ulises Suarez - picks up the torch, and charges  toward the historic 2022 marriage equality victory that would finally let love win in  revolutionary Cuba.",
