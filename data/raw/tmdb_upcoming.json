Amid the chaos, Said reunited with Sari, his childhood sweetheart, but their relationship was hindered by Sari’s mother, Santika, who was determined to make Sari the lead dancer in the village's ritual. Unaware of the true importance of her role, Sari found herself caught in a dangerous web of intrigue involving Santika, Ningsih, and the village chief. Ningsih, who aspired to take the lead dancer's place, was willing to do anything—including using black magic—to threaten Sari. Meanwhile, Ki Dalang, the leader of the ritual, struggled to uncover who truly possessed the qualities to become the lead dancer. This search led to a confrontation with dark forces that threatened everyone involved. This tale, rich in mystery and conflict, tests the limits of love, trust, and tradition.",

British artist Dylan Holloway, formerly known as Lots Holloway, stepped away from the spotlight during the 2020 lockdown to begin his gender transition. Once a rising star on the UK’s X-Factor, Dylan now faces a profound personal and professional crossroads: hormone therapy could irreversibly change the voice that once defined his career. Blending candid video diaries, family footage, and intimate interviews, Tomorrow’s Too Late traces Dylan’s early life, his struggle with identity, and the emotional toll of life lived in public. At once a music documentary and a deeply moving portrait of trans experience, the film captures the courage it takes to risk everything in pursuit of an authentic self.",

They interview President Zelenskyy, who is reluctant to travel to Washington, and then watch the rebroadcast of the meeting with Ukrainian soldiers in a bunker. For the real heroes are the anonymous fighters and civilians who hold their heads high in the face of adversity and suffering, and who are filmed on a daily basis.

Through the eyes of an enthusiastic teacher, a jaded caretaker and a sharp-witted mother, the salt lake is seen as a vital lifeline. Between harvests and floods, the lake transforms from a role that is central to local identity and offering a promising industry, to become a symbol of failed development. The low price of salt adds to the woes of toxic labour conditions. And yet, for many in Katwe it remains the only path of opportunity. As a flamboyant, retro-styled local politician pushes grand plans onto a crumbling mine and community, the local population reflects on what the future holds.",

        "overview": "In one of the most polluted regions of France, a small industrial town by the Mediterranean Sea lives in striking contrast, where smokestacks loom and super tankers drift by, yet people swim, dance, and savour life. Amid the haze of factories and the hum of semi-trailers, a resilient community clings to joy and routine. At the edge of the freeway, Natalie’s food truck has stood for thirty years, serving as a symbol of perseverance and humanity. This visually rich, emotionally resonant film captures the paradox of living between industrial ruin and natural beauty, where survival means choosing not to look right at the smoke, but left, towards the sea.",

More politicized, united and socially conscious, the 1990s crop came along to put an end to the conflicts of the \"old-timers\" and bring new life to an engaged and active scene, ushering in new talent to the Brazilian music landscape, with important names such as No Violence, Agrotóxico, Ação Direta, Garage Fuzz, Dominatrix, among others.",

Gillian, exhausted from juggling a corporate job and caregiving, tries to focus Ava’s attention on healing instead of hobbies – but her efforts to control Ava only deepen the rift between them.  As Ava’s dress takes shape, so does her sense of autonomy, challenging Gillian’s idea of what recovery should look like. The tension escalates when an argument over therapy turns physical, leading to a moment of violence neither sister intended. But in the aftermath, the sisters begin to glimpse a different way forward – messy, uncertain, and stitched with care.",
